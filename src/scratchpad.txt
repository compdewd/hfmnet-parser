average lines:
    take each line and compare it to the lines that already exist
		(comparing slot_name, core_type, core_version, username)
	if a record already exists that matches the current line
		then add data for the PPD and TPF and the date
	else
		then add to the vector of new records with the data of the current line
	go to line 4 while new lines still exist
	take each distinct new record and the values for each project and average them and store result
	find the least recent date and use as the date for the new record
	store the new record in a vector of new record structs
